## Introduction
1. Component Scanning : The way spring can automatically discover components from an application's classpath and create them as beans in the spring application
   context (the core container that spring provides at it's core).

2. Autowiring : This is the way spring automatically injects the components with the other beans that they depend on.


### The MVC

1. **Model** :
2. **View** : 
3. **Controller** : At the center of
   Spring MVC is the concept of a controller, a class that handles requests and responds
   with information of some sort.
A controller class will handle request for a resource path (say root '/') and generate model by populating model then forward to view to genrate the html.
